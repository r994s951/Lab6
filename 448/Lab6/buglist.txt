isEmpty, addBack, size, and both removeFront and removeBack do not work.

isEmpty does not return false if there is an item in the list.

addBack does not correctly add to the back of the list but instead to the front.

removeBack does not work correctly.

removeFront does not work correctly.

Because of this we discover size doesn't decrement after a remove but work for increments.
